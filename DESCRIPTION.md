### Project Name:  
Floral Palette

#### Project Pitch  
With the popularity of websites like Pinterest, a lot of brides and grooms have unrealistic visions of their weddings especially in terms of budget and florals amongst many other wedding details. While working in the floral industry, I noticed a lot of brides and grooms coming in for consultations with images of bouquets that were their dream bouquet but they soon come to find that the flowers in the photos are out of season or extremely expensive. Basically a dream crusher... I want to create an app that will help brides to be (or grooms) decide what their main wedding flowers will be based on the season of their wedding and their color palette. To help avoid dream crushing in floral consultations. This app will take 4 parameters (season, and three colors) and generate a list of flowers that will be in season and available for their wedding.

#### Final Notes 
All in all, I was happy with the outcome of my module 3 personal project. I wasn't able to find an API that I was happy with to source my flower information from, so I decided to hard code the data. As is, Floral Palette only has 22 flowers currently in it's database. I am hoping to expand that as time goes on or experiment with some web scrapping in module 4. I used to work at a floral shop, so the majority of the photos are ones that I took myself. I would have like to have all of the photos be my own, but it is a work in progress. Floral Palette is far from being completed and is still a work in progress.
