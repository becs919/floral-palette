Floral Palette

#### Project Pitch  
With the popularity of websites like Pinterest, a lot of brides and grooms have unrealistic visions of their weddings especially in terms of budget and florals amongst many other wedding details. While working in the floral industry, I noticed a lot of brides and grooms coming in for consultations with images of bouquets that were their dream bouquet but they soon come to find that the flowers in the photos are out of season or extremely expensive. Basically a dream crusher... I want to create an app that will help brides to be (or grooms) decide what their main wedding flowers will be based on the season of their wedding and their color palette. To help avoid dream crushing in floral consultations. This app will take 4 parameters (season, and three colors) and generate a list of flowers that will be in season and available for their wedding.
